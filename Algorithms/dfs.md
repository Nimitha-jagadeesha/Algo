problem: Breadth first search

# Solution
* Depth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, a node may be visited twice. To avoid processing a node more than once, use a boolean visited array.
# Implementation

~~~cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
     long long int n,m;
     cin>>n>>m;
}
